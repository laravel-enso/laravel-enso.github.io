## The Story
- why Laravel Enso exists
- how did we approach the need
- what was born


## Under the hood 

### Authentication
 - the standard Laravel authentication is used, via email & password

### Authorization

 - application wide, checking user status: active/inactive. The inactive status prevents the user from making requests. The check is made for every request, via a middleware. If a user is made inactive while he's still logged in, at his next request he'll be logged out.
 - application-section wide, via the menu visibility, depending on the user's role. The users that don't have access to a certain menu, can't see it. The check is made for each menu redraw. This level doesn't block access to routes, it just affects the visibility of the menus.
 - application-section wide, depending on access to routes, which is tied to the user's role and the permissions for that role. If he doesn't have access a 403 response is given back and a `laravel.log` entry is made.The check is made for each request, via a middleware. 
 - content specific, via policies. The check is made locally, when and where policies are used.

### Middleware & Middleware Groups
  - for the routes within the application, the 'core' middleware group is applied
  - the 'core' group contains the middleware below, presented in the order they're applied: 
     - `verify-active-state` - checks users's status (active/inactive)
     - `action-logger` - logs for each request the user's id, route, url, the HTTP verb and the timestamps
     - `verify-route-access` - authorizes the access for a route
     - `impersonate` - starts and stops the [impersonation](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Impersonate) of a user, when needed
     - `set-language` - sets the user's chosen language (locale)

### Permission Groups
  



### [Permissions](https://github.com/laravel-enso/PermissionManager) & Routes
  
  
    


### Owners, [Roles](https://github.com/laravel-enso/RoleManager) & Users
  - users represent the operators using the application
  - roles may be loosely considered groups of permissions
  - owners may be considered user groups, they are the user's owners
  - an owner may have many users
  - an owner may have many roles
  - an user can have **just one owner** and **just one role**  
  - the role of a user user may only be one of the roles available for the owner
  - when a user is created, one must choose an owner and then a role from the list of available roles  
  - users have an active or inactive status, where inactive users cannot login into the application (but can set/reset their password) 

### [Menus](https://github.com/laravel-enso/MenuManager) & [Roles](https://github.com/laravel-enso/RoleManager)
  
  


### Breadcrumbs
  - are dynamically generated depending on the current route
  - the displayed text may be customized and, if custom values are missing, the default values are used
  - inserting breadcrumbs in a page may be easily done by including the `breadcrumbs` package that comes with the package  



### [Telemetry](https://github.com/laravel-enso/ActionLogger)
   
   - the implicit `login` event that Laravel fires on a user's login triggers the save of the user's ip, user-agent and timestamp inside the `logins` table



### Exceptions    
   - where needed, `EnsoException` instances are thrown
   - depending on the type of the request (ajax or non ajax) a different response is given back   


### [Localisation](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Localisation)



### Preferences

The mechanism allows saving and loading upon login the user's preferences for a several aspects of the application.
- the preferences can be updated from the right-hand sidebar, where the user can also reset them as well as restart the tutorial function for the current page
- inside the `preferences` table, within `value` JSON type attribute, the following keys/settings are kept
    - `lang` - the user's language
    - `theme` - the currently selected theme
    - dtStateSave - flag for saving the state/preferences for each data-table within the application (for up to 90 days)
    - fixedHeader - the option of making the header fixed or scrollable
    - collapsedSidebar - flag for starting with / keeping the main left-hand navigation sidebar open or closed

### Environment
- .env & config
   - for push notifications, we use [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), therefore the following values must be set in the `.env` file:
      - BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
      - PUSHER_APP_ID=xxx
      - PUSHER_APP_KEY=xxx
      - PUSHER_APP_SECRET=xxx
   - within the configuration file `config/larave-enso.php` various options may be set, such as the folders used for storing uploads, avatars, etc. the caching duration and the timestamps format when displaying them
